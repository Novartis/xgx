\alias{xgx_breaks_time}
\title{Sets the default breaks for a time axis}
\usage{
xgx_breaks_time(data.range, units.plot)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.range}{range of the data}

\item{units.plot}{units to use in the plot}
}
\description{
\code{xgx_breaks_time} sets the default breaks for a time axis, 
given the units of the data and the units of the plot.
It is inspired by scales::extended_breaks
}
\details{
for the extended breaks function, 
Q is a set of nice increments
w is a set of 4 weights for
\enumerate{
\item simplicity - how early in the Q order are you
\item coverage - labelings that don't extend outside the data: range(data)/range(labels)
\item density (previously granuality) - how cloes to the number of ticks do you get (default is 5)
\item legibility - has to do with fontsize and formatting to prevent label overlap
}
}
