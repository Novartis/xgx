\title{Sets the default breaks for log10}
\usage{
xgx_breaks_log10(data.range)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.range}{range of the data}
}
\description{
\code{xgx_breaks_log10} sets nice breaks for log10 scale.
it's better than the default function because it ensures there is at least 2 breaks
and also, it will try to go by 3s (i.e. 1,3,10,30,100) if it makes sense
}
\details{
for the extended breaks function Q is a set of nice increments and
w is a set of 4 weights for:

\enumerate{
\item simplicity - how early in the Q order are you
\item coverage - labelings that don't extend outside the data: range(data)/range(labels)
\item density (previously granuality) - how cloes to the number of ticks do you get (default is 5)
\item legibility - has to do with fontsize and formatting to prevent label overlap
}
}
