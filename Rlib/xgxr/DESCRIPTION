Description: Supports a structured approach
    for exploring PKPD data <https://opensource.nibr.com/xgx>. It also
    contains helper functions for enabling the modeler to follow best R
    practices (by appending the program name, figure name location, and
    draft status to each plot). In addition, it enables the modeler to
    follow best graphical practices (by providing a theme that
    reduces chart ink, and by providing time-scale, log-scale, and
    reverse-log-transform-scale functions for more readable axes).
    Finally, it provides some data checking and summarizing functions for
    rapidly exploring pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) datasets.
